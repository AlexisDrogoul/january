# Eclipse January Examples and Getting Started

## What is this?

This is the getting started project for the [Eclipse January](https://github.com/eclipse/january) project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
1. Import the [org.eclipse.january.examples](/org.eclipse.january.examples) project into your Eclipse development environment.
1. Open the target platform file [JanuaryExamples.target](/org.eclipse.january.examples/JanuaryExamples.target) and press "Set as Target Platform" in the upper right hand side. The P2 URL of interest is http://download.eclipse.org/january/builds/latest/repository.
1. Open the [Basic Example](/org.eclipse.january.examples/src/org/eclipse/january/examples/dataset/BasicExample.java) and run it as a Java Application for a quick demo.

## Next Steps

Browse through the more advanced examples.
- [NumPy Examples](/org.eclipse.january.examples/src/org/eclipse/january/examples/dataset/NumpyExamples.java) shows how common NumPy constructs map to Eclipse Datasets.
- [Slicing Examples](/org.eclipse.january.examples/src/org/eclipse/january/examples/dataset/SlicingExamples.java) demonstrates slicing, including how to slice a small amount of data out of a dataset too large to fit in memory all at once.
- [Error Examples](/org.eclipse.january.examples/src/org/eclipse/january/examples/dataset/ErrorExamples.java) demonstrates applying an error to datasets.
- [Iteration Examples](/org.eclipse.january.examples/src/org/eclipse/january/examples/dataset/IterationExamples.java) demonstrates a few ways to iterate through your datasets.
- [Lazy Examples](/org.eclipse.january.examples/src/org/eclipse/january/examples/dataset/LazyExamples.java) demonstrates how to use datasets which are not entirely loaded in memory.
